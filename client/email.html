        <div class="col-md-12"><p>Herein lies the text of the email, which conveys the real meat of the message. It tries vigorously to maintain a thematic tone which centralizes its objective. The writer's efforts shall be evident within the confines of his work, or he risks the email going unread. Should he wish to mitigate the costs of such an event occuring, he has the option of placing a "Too Long, Didn't Read" field at the end of the message. However this is risky as it adds an amateur tone to the body of the message. </p></div>
